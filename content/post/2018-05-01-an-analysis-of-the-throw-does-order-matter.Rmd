summary: Does a player have a higher chance of hitting a treble with their first dart? Are they more likely to hit a double with their last dart? This post contains an analysis of the differences in the 2018 Premier League players' abilities to hit the intended target with the first, second, and third dart.

Michael Smith appears to have a statistically significant difference in the probability of successfully hitting a treble with his first and second darts (the confidence intervals don't overlap in the figure above indicating a statistical significance). The probability is higher for him to successfully hit a treble with his second dart, than it is for him to successfully hit a treble with his first dart. 

Interestingly, Michael Smith is the only player who shows any sign of a (statistically) significant difference in the probability of successfully hitting a treble with his 3 darts.

There are no statistically significant differences in the probability of any player to successfully hit the double with their first, second, or third darts. Despite this, it appears that Gary Anderson may have a slightly lower probability of successfully hitting a double with his *last* dart, whereas Michael van Gerwen appears to have a slightly lower probability of successfully hitting the double with his *first* dart.

There are no statistically significant differences in the probability of any player to successfully hit the bullseye with their first, second, or third darts.
