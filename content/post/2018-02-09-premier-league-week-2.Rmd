- **3-dart average**
    
    Average score per dart, multiplied by 3.

- **Average accuracy**

    Accuracy is calculated using a Bayesian state-space model for the probability of the player hitting their intended target with the current dart. The average accuracy is simply the average estimated probability over the entire game.

- **Breaks**

    Total number of legs won when the opposition threw first.

- **Legs**

    Total number of legs won.

- **100+ checkout**

    Total number of legs finished with a checkout higher than 100.

- **Highest checkout**

    The highest score that won a leg.
