summary: Michael van Gerwen has the highest probability of hitting the treble he is aiming for. He has a probability around 0.47, which is statistically higher than all the other players, except for Gary Anderson's, whose treble probability is around 0.44. Rob Cross has the highest double percentage, and Raymond van Barneveld has the highest bullseye accuracy.
